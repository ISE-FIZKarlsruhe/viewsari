# Welcome to Viewsari: Explore Knowledge in Vasari's The Lives

This web application is a collection of different perspectives on the Viewsari knowledge graph.
The Viewsari KG acts as a gateway to *Vasari's Renaissance*, aiming to transform Giorgio Vasari's chef-d'œuvre 
*Lives of the Most Eminent Painters Sculptors and Architects* into a flexible and scalable graph representation of
the text and its contents. Viewsari is intended as an integrated system of ontology, KG, and web app and shall provide
the possibility to explore and query information related to artists, their shared relationships,
their artworks, and other connected entities.
The data model is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL).

The information extraction phase is further explained under the [corresponding site](ie.md).

The ontology's development is further explained on [this site](ontological_engineering.md).

## Discover Insights through Network Visualizations

All the world's a graph and Giorgio Vasari's seminal work is an all-encompassing system of interconnected knowledge.
In the future, Viewsari will allow you to explore complex relationships within this work using interactive network visualizations, hoping to reveal hidden patterns, connections, and dependencies.
This shall support you in your research of Vasari's work with a low-level entry point.

## Unleash the Power of SPARQL with SHMARQL, Your Semantic Exploration Companion
SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is the heart of semantic data exploration. 
With Viewsari's built-in SPARQL endpoint, you can query the knowledge graph directly.
SHMARQL is our intuitive SPARQL exploration tool. It bridges the gap between technical complexity and user-friendly interaction. Here’s what SHMARQL offers:

- Query Builder: No need to memorize SPARQL syntax! SHMARQL provides a visual query builder. Drag and drop nodes, edges, and filters to construct your queries effortlessly.
- Auto-Suggestions: As you type, SHMARQL suggests relevant predicates, classes, and resources. Say goodbye to typos and syntax errors.
- Graph Visualization: Execute your SPARQL queries and visualize the results as interactive graphs. Explore nodes, expand relationships, and navigate through your knowledge graph dynamically.
- Export and Share: Export query results, graphs, or visualizations in various formats. Collaborate with colleagues or embed insights in your reports.
